# electron-react-webpack-quick-start

A minimal, cross-platform Electron application with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for views and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). Set breakpoints and debug the main process with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). ES6/ES2015 support using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

## To Build and Run via CLI

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/jogleasonjr/electron-react-webpack-quick-start
# Go into the repository
cd electron-react-webpack-quick-start
# Install dependencies and run the app
npm install && npm run dev
```

### Hot Reloading

To watch for local changes and trigger [automatic refresh](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#automatic-refresh), run these two commands in separate console windows:

```bash
# Run in console window 1
npm run watch
# Run in console window 2
npm run dev
```

## To Build and Run in Visual Studio Code

In [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), pressing `Ctrl-Shift-B` (Windows) or `Cmd-Shift-B` (OSX) will build and bundle the application, and pressing `F5` will debug the application. Make sure you have the proper OS selection in the VS Code's [Debug View](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging).
